There is no criterion of salary for the brilliant or experienced candidate.

<br><b><font size="+2">Book & Study Material</font></b></br>

During the course of civil engineering, you will get to know about the design, hydraulics, construction, earth mechanism, soil mechanism, construction management, computer methods, structural machine, environmental nature & issues and traffic & transport.

Most of time, students are puzzled when they are being asked about the right book by the right author (accordance to their study).

<br>The top recommended books of Civil Engineering are as the follows:</br>

<br><b>Basic Civil Engineering by S Ramamrutham</b></br>

<br><b>Basic Civil Engineering by Satheesh Gopi</b></br>

<br><b>Basics of Civil Engineering by Subhash Chander</b></br>

<br><b>Basic Structural Analysis by C.S. Reddy</b></br>

<br><b>Advanced Reinforced Concrete Design by N Krishna Raju</b></br>

You can choose the mechanical engineering, once you have completed your secondary or Sr. secondary examination.

<br>The academic criterion of Mechanical enginering is divided into three courses/programmes as follows:

Diploma courses leading to the polytechnic diploma of 3 yearsduration.UG courses leading to the B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degree of 4 years duration.PG courses leading to the M.Tech (Master of Technology) degree of 2 yearsduration.

Beside these, it is one of the broad research fields leading to the PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)degree.

After the completion of 10th standard, you are only eligible to enter the diploma courses. After completing 12th standard you are fully eligible to choose the UG (B.Tech) programme.

For entering in Mechanical Engineering, either in diploma or UG, mathematics and physicsare the compulsory and has to be in the qualifying examination.

For entering in PG (M.Tech) programme, B.Tech in mechanical engineering is must.

So now, you have a complete package of education in Mechanical Engineering after 10th upto research programme.

So many institutions are offering the Distance Education or Online Education in Mechanical Engineering in India and Abroad.

In most countries, you will have to be certified by the professional body after completion of your degree in Mechanical engineering.

To get admission in engineering courses, candidates have to qualify the entrance test. These exams are organized at national, state and university level. JEE Main is a national level exam organized by the CBSE board to offer admission in B.Tech courses. For admission in M.Tech courses students can appear in the GATE examination.

For this certification process, you will have to fulfill a range of conditions including mandatory exam at the end of the course and work experience before being certified. Then you will be designated as the Professional Engineer (USA, Canada & SA), a Chartered Engineer (Commonwealth Countries), and European Engineers (European Countries).

In Spain, Portugal and South America the degree is conducted with the formal name as â€œMechanical Engineerâ€? of six years duration.

Biotechnology Engineering is an emerging and demanding field of engineering & technology.

In the course curriculum of Biotechnology Engineering, the students will get to use the engineering expertise to solve the problems and analyses in medicine and biology, agriculture and research, and development of vaccines.

For doing Biotechnology Engineering, you need to have the mathematics, chemistry, biology in 10+2 standard.

After completion of UG degree the students are designated as the Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology, depending on the University.

A bachelor degree usually covers the mathematics, biology, chemistry and computer.

You can choose the Biotechnology Engineering, once you have completed your 10 or 10+2 examination with mathematics and science.

The academic criterion of Biotechnology Engineering is divided into three courses/programmes as follows:

Diploma courses leading to the polytechnic diploma of 3 years duration. (after 10th or 12th)UG courses leading to the B.Tech(Bachelor of Technology) degree of 4 years duration. (after 12th)PG courses leading to the M.Tech(Master of Technology) degree of 2 yearsduration. (after graduation)

Beside these, it is a growing discipline in research fields leading to the PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) degree.

For entering in PG (M.Tech/M.E/M.S) programme, B.Tech in Biotechnology Engineering is must.

India has the best environment to advantage the research programme in the field of Biotechnology Engineering due to various climatically conditions, long coastal line and largest biodiversity.

				<h3><font size="+4"><font color="purple">Food Technology</font></font></h3>
				<p><br><b><font size="+2">Course & Duration</font></b></br>

In the past, the food technology was adopted and discovered for just preserving and adding the flavor and color into the food stuff, but later on, by the development of science and engineering this technology has been used for the drying, de-caffeination, self-cooking food and for various research areas in the food science.

As deep as we are going into the dimensions of food technology, we require the experts and professionals in this field.  The subject comprises of both science and engineering. Many academies and colleges in India have started to offer variety of courses in the field of food technology.

<br>There are four types of programmes in the field of food technology in India. They are described as follows:</br>

<br>Polytechnic diploma course with the duration of 3 years after 10+2 examination</br>
<br>Diploma Course in Food Analysis and Quality Assurance</br>
<br>Diploma in Food Science Technology</br>
<br>Dipoma in Food Science, Preservation and Management</br>
<br>UG degree courses leading to the B.Scand B.Tech with the duration of 4 yearsafter 10+2 examination</br>

<br>Doctoral degree courses leading to the PhD domain with the duration of 1-2 years after the completion of PG degree.</br>

In these courses, the students are taught about the engineering and science techniques and activities which are involved in food processing, fermentation, preservation, microbiology, analytical chemistry, home science and flavor & color index.

<br><b><font size="+2">Admission</font></b></br>

For admission in diploma programmes and the UG degree leading to the B.Tech and the B.Sc degree courses, the candidate must have passed the plus two examinations/12thclass/10+2 with the minimum of 50% with science subjects out of chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, home science.

The students from the different domain in education degree in the UG programme such as the UG in hotel management, B.Sc with life science or the UG in home science may get the admission in PG degree courses in the field of food technology.

Many of Indian colleges or the universities have marked the criterion of entrance examination before the admission in any of the above programmes. Some of the entrance examinations includes the following, which are conducted by the various universities in India:

<br><b>JEEP (Joint Entrance Examination Polytechnic)</b></br>
<br><b>CFTRI (Central Food Technological Research Institute Entrance Examination)</b></br>
<br><b>IICPT (Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology Entrance Examination)</b></br>
