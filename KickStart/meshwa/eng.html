After B.Tech, students can also go for higher studies and pursue M.tech or MBA.

<br><b>Career Options After M.Tech</b>

Teaching and research careers are open for engineers who hold postgraduate degrees in engineering. If you are holding M.tech degree then you will get preference or gain higher position in corporate companies. Both private as well as government sector gives priority to candidate with a higher degree.</p>

<br><h3>Jobs & Career</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

Engineering is one of the best job oriented educational programme across the world. It is a professional educational course.

There are a lot of chances to get the reputed job once done the engineering course.

Today, the world is playing with the technology. Everything is depending on the computerization and above all we are still striving to achieve the height of development.

<b><i>The world needs experts who are engineers.</i></b>

There are various reputed industries in India and in abroad, looking for the engineers.</p>

<br><h3>Job titles:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

You will get the job title depending upon your specialization. For example, if you have completed engineering with Computer Science branch then you may be designated as software engineer, software developer, system designer, etc.
</p>
<br><h3>Salary</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A fresher engineer can earn the<b><i> 2.5 lakh to 3.5 lakh per annum</i></b> in India. But, if he moves to the abroad, he can earn around<b><i> $80000 to 100000 per annum</i></b>.

It is a good salaried professional course rather than some others.</p>

				<h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
				<p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The academic criterion of civil engineering is divided in three courses/programmes as follows:

<br><b>Diploma courses leading to the polytechnic diploma of 3 years duration.</b> UG courses leading to the B.Tech(Bachelor of Technology) degree of 4 years duration.PG courses leading to the M.Tech(Master of Technology) degree of 2 years duration.

Beside these, it is one of the broad research fields leading to the PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) degree.

Some other courses of Civil Engineering are listed below:

<br><b>Diploma Courses:</b> 

Diploma in Civil & Rural Advance Diploma in Civil Engineering,Post Graduate Diploma in Civil Engineering

<br><b>Bachelor Courses:</b> 

Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Ceramics & Cement Technology,Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Civil Infrastructure Engineering,Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Civil & Transportation Engineering

<br><b>Master Courses:</b> 

Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Civil Structural Design,Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Building Technology & Construction Management

After the completion of 10th standard, you are only eligible to enter the diploma courses. Once you have done the 12th standard you are fully eligible to choose the UG (B.Tech) programme.

For entering in Civil Engineering, either in diploma or UG, mathematics and physics are the compulsory and has to be in qualifying examination.

For entering in PG (M.Tech) programme, B.Tech in civil engineering is must.

So now, you have a complete package of education in Civil Engineering after 10th upto research programme.</p>

<br><h3>Specialization (Sub-disciplines)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Civil engineering is a deep field of technical education. It has divided in various specializations after completed the B.Tech degree.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
During the course of civil engineering, you will get to know about the design, hydraulics, construction, earth mechanism, soil mechanism, construction management, computer methods, structural machine, environmental nature & issues and traffic & transport.

Most of time, students are puzzled when they are being asked about the right book by the right author (accordance to their study).

<br>The top recommended books of Civil Engineering are as the follows: 
<br><br>Basic Civil Engineering by S Ramamrutham, Basic Civil Engineering by Satheesh Gopi, Basics of Civil Engineering by Subhash Chander, Basic Structural Analysis by C.S. Reddy, Advanced Reinforced Concrete Design by N Krishna Raju, Analysis of Structures by T S Thandavamoorthy, Geotechnical Engineering by Donald P Coduto, Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering by Steven L Kramor, Hydraulics & Fluid Mechanics by Modi</p>

				<h2>Food Technology</h2>
				<p><h3>Course & Duration</h3> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the past, the food technology was adopted and discovered for just preserving and adding the flavor and color into the food stuff, but later on, by the development of science and engineering this technology has been used for the drying, de-caffeination, self-cooking food and for various research areas in the food science.

As deep as we are going into the dimensions of food technology, we require the experts and professionals in this field.  The subject comprises of both science and engineering. Many academies and colleges in India have started to offer variety of courses in the field of food technology.
There are four types of programmes in the field of food technology in India. They are described as follows: 

<br><br>Polytechnic diploma course with the duration of 3 years after 10+2 examination, Diploma Course in Food Analysis and Quality Assurance, Diploma in Food Science Technology, Dipoma in Food Science, Preservation and Management, UG degree courses leading to the B.Scand B.Tech with the duration of 4 yearsafter 10+2 examination, Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Food Technology, Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Food Science, Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Food and Nutrition, Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Food Preservation, Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Food Engineering, PG degree courses leading to the M.Scand, M.Tech with the duration of 2 years, after the completion of UG degree in engineering, Master of Science (M.Sc) in Food Science, Master of Science (M.Sc) in Food Technology, Master of Science (M.Sc) in Food and Fermentation Technology and Food Science, Master of Science (M.Sc) in Food and Nutrition, Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Food Technology, Doctoral degree courses leading to the PhD domain with the duration of 1-2 years after the completion of PG degree.
In tese courses, the students are taught about the engineering and science techniques and activities which are involved in food processing, fermentation, preservation, microbiology, analytical chemistry, home science and flavor & color index.
</p>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
